First Kubernetes cluster!

The idea is to spin up a cluster made of three nodes, one  controlplane and two worker nodes.
Kubeadm is used to create the cluster and I use the IaC vagrant from HashiCorp to create, run and provision each VM. 
Tools used:
- Vagrant
- ubuntu images
- Kubeadm 
- containerd

Ps: My OS is a Windows machine.
